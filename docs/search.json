You’ll learn the basic principles of effective data visualization, and get hands-on with popular Python libraries to create your own compelling plots.\n\n\nWhat To Prepare\nIn this workshop, we will mostly use Google Colab as our coding environment. Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources.\nPlease make sure you have a Google account and can access Google Colab. If you have not used Google Colab before, please go through the three Colab tutorials below to get familiar with the environment.\n\nWelcome to Colab!\nOverview of Colab\nGuide to Markdown\n\nIf you want to get a head start on basic plotting in Python, you can work through the below notebook from Google.\n\nCharts: visualizing data\n\n\n\n\nPart I: Principles & Good Practices\nIn other words, what is a good chart, and a good way to make one.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\nPart II: Intro to Matplotlib\n\nConcepts and basic plots\n\nSlides\nNotebook 1: Concepts (  )\nNotebook 2: Basic plots (  )\n\nFrom default to publication-ready\n\nSlides\nNotebook: Mag 7 (  )\n\n\n\n\nPart III: Plotting Maps (with Geopandas and Matplotlib)\n\nSpatial data basics and plotting\n\nSlides\nNotebook: Geopandas intro (  )\n\nReproducing the Toronto Parking Tickets Visualization\n\nNotebook: Parking tickets (  )\n\n\n\n\nPart IV: Dashboarding (with Quarto and Plotly Express)\n\nSlides\nCode 1: Client-only interactivity (superstore.qmd)\nCode 2: Py-shiny-based interactivity (superstore-v2.qmd)\nAssets: Superstore data and logo\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nLearning\n\nGood Charts by Scott Berinato (main reference for Part I; available via UofT library.)\nScientific Visualization: Python + Matplotlib by Nicolas P. Rougier (mastering Matplotlib)\nFundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke\nDatawrapper Blog\nFlowing Data by Nathan Yau\nFrom Data to Viz (sample code of various types of charts)\n\nInspiration\n\nJoseph’s Github dataviz repo (Python)\nTanya Shapiro’s GitHub Gallery (R)\nDataviz Inspiration (various tools)\nFronkonstin (R)\nData Imaginist (R)\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
