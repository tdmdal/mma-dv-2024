        "\n",
        "Matplotlib's software architecture has three main layers. From bottom to top, they are backend layer, artist layer, and script layer. We briefly discuss each layer's function.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Backend layer (`matplotlib.backend_bases`). Backends handle the hard work behind the scenes to display Matplotlib figures on the screen under different settings/environments. For example, when you plot a figure in a Python shell, a plot window pops up to display the figure. On the other hand, if you use Jupyter notebook (Google Colab included) and draw an inline plot, the plot displays directly in the notebook. The backend layer defines all the primitives that each setting/environment must implement to serve as a backend.\n",
        "\n",
        "    There are three main components in the backend layer, `FigureCanvasBase`, `RendererBase`, and `event`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.1 `FigureCanvasBase` deals with the area onto which the figure is drawn, i.e., the canvas.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.2 `RendererBase` knows how to draw on the `FigureCanvas`, just like a paintbrush.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.3 `Event` handles user inputs such as a mouse click.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Artist layer (`matplotlib.artist.Artist`). An artist knows how to use a paintbrush (`RendererBase`) to draw on a canvas (`FigureCanvasBase`). All visible elements in a figure are artist objects. Typcially, when composing a plot, we work with artists most of the time. There are two types of artists.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.1 Primitives. They are graphical objects we want to paint onto the canvas: `Line2D`, `Rectangle`, `Text`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.2 Containers. They are places to hold the primitives, for example, `Figure`, `Axes`, `Axis`, etc. A container can contain one or more other containers, for example, a `Figure` can contain one or more `Axes` (subplots). `Axes` are Matplotlib's term for subplots (not the plural of Axis). A subplot is a region for plotting. A 2D subplot, for example, contains two `Axis` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Script layer (`matplotlib.pyplot`). A light wrapper/interface to the artist layer. It makes plotting simple graphics easy for average users.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you will see below, whether you work at the artist layer or the script layer represents two different approaches of plotting, but first let us take a look at how a plot organizes its artists objects (primitives and containers)."

        "\n",
        "There are two ways to use matplotlib.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Work at the script layer. Call `plt.plot()` and other top-level `matplotlib.pyplot` functions to do the plotting (e.g., `plt.bar()`, `plt.title()`, `plt.ylabel()`, etc.) . With this approach you implicitly manage Figures, Axes and other elements in a plot, i.e., you do not specify which Figure and Axes you want to work on, you always work on the *current* Figure and Axes. This approach is sometimes called implicit interface approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Work at the artist layer. With this approach, you explicitly create Figures and Axes objects and call methods on them. This approach is sometimes called Object Oriented (OO) approach or explicit interface approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first approach is convenient for beginners to get started, however, we recommend using the second approach (so does the official Matplotlib document; see [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html#coding-styles)), particularly for complicated plots, as you can better customize and fine-tune your plots at the artist level. In addition, being explicit on which Figure and Axes you are plotting on is in general a better coding style.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, most of the functions in the first approach is just a thin wrapper of the second approach. For example, the bar plot function `plt.bar()` would simply first get the current Axes instance (`gca()`, get current axes) and then call the `bar()` method of the axes instance. (This is evident if you check the [source code](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v3.8.2/lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py#L2728-L2747) of `plt.bar()`)\n",
